# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
#
# Here are some files you may want to ignore globally:

# scm revert files
**.orig

# Mac finder artifacts
.DS_Store

# Netbeans project directory
/nbproject/

# vim artifacts
**.swp

# Environment files that may contain sensitive data
.env
.powenv

# PHP projects specific
.phpcomplete_extended/

# Shopify Theme bundler
/theme.lock

# For Visual Studio Code
.vscode
